    <h1>About Lively Fit</h1>
    <p>Lively Fit was made to inspire and motivate people to start listening to their bodies
        and taking control of their mental clarity. Our goal is to educate people how to 
        start their yoga journeys safely without injuring themselves.
        We want to have an safe and open space for people to connect with.
        
        As of right now we only do posts about meditation, yoga and spirituality, but we are looking to
        expand out topics so please feel free to send us suggestions. 
        
        Our posts are in English only but we are looking for ways to be more versatile and include a
        translate option in the near future. </p>
