        Yoga can seem like a lot at first, and more stressful than 
        calming. It's important to start slow and focus on what 
        you can do instead of what you can't do.
        There is 8 different types of yoga practice, ashtanga yoga,
        hatha yoga, hot yoga, Iyengar yoga, kundalini yoga,
        power yoga, restorative yoga and vinyasa yoga.

        Usually it is recommended to start with restorative or
        vinyasa yoga. It is easy on your body and is more 
        beginner friendly. I would recommend if you can
        to go at in person call first so they can correct your form
        and help you with your own struggles through the session.

        Watching classes thought YouTube or other platforms, can
        be really helpful and less intimidating. But its hard to tell
        on yourself if your form is correct. If you take it slow and
        feel how your body is responding it can be helpful as you can feel 
        if something is off. There is a difference between muscle soreness and muscle ache.
